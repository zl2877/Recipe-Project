Name:
mom's chai
description:
smells like home for some people, for others it's just a drink they like but either way this is how someone's mom would make it <3
ingredients: 
your choice of milk
water to dillute if money's tight 
cardamom whole or ground
clove whole or ground
pepper
cinnamon
sugar
assam black tea (the ones in the red package are my go to)
instructions:
add milk or milk+water into a pot and bring to a simmer
add sugar and aromatics+spices
let simmer until sugar's dissolved and mixture becomes aromatic
add in your black tea and bring to a boil
tip: keep stirring to prevent the milk from boiling
the way i learned is to let it boil until you get the color you want, but it's probably more scientific than that
DONT LET IT BOIL OVER it's so sad if that happens, if you dont wanna stir, just remove from heat before boiling over a couple times 
strain milk to make sure all whole spices + tea is seperated or skip if you used bags
serve warm! or do whatever you want to make it cold idc lol
